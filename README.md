# MERN Lab

Get ready to build your first MERN app! For this lab, your goal is to build a
simple MERN app with Express on the back-end and React on the front-end. Your
app should have one and only one model!

**This is an open-ended, pair lab!**


## Pairs

You will be working in pairs. We will leave the group selection up to you. Feel free find a partner after the lab has been introduced.

Pair programming is a common industry practice where two developers work on the same project together. Typically, one person is the "driver" and the other is the "navigator". Throughout the lab you must switch roles.

Here are two explanations of pair-programming, it's benefits and how to do it:
1. [Pair Programming Considered Extremely Beneficial](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/pair-programming-considered-extremely-beneficial)
2. [Agile Best Practices: Pair Programming](https://www.versionone.com/agile-101/agile-software-programming-best-practices/pair-programming/)

## Prerequisites

- Mongo, Mongoose, Express and Node
- React, Components, State and Props
- React Component Lifecycle Methods
- React Router

## Instructions

1.  Create 2 separate repos for your front-end and back-end code.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

**_DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY_**

Create the repos. Complete the requirements below and post
an issue on this repository linking to the relevant front-end and back-end repo(s) under your GitHub
account. 

For this lab, you may pair up with one other person. Since we haven't yet
covered git workflows, you'll have to research the `git branch`, `git checkout`,
and `git merge` commands and how to use them together. The
[Atlassian git tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) site is a
great starting point, particularly the
[Feature Branch Workflow Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

## Requirements

Build a simple MERN app! Keep it very simple: only 1 model with full CRUD.

Your app should have a back-end build with Express that persists data to a
MongoDB database using Mongoose. Your Express app should return JSON data to
your React front-end.

The front-end for your simple MERN app should be built with React. Use AJAX to
get data from your Express back-end and pass the data through your app using
state and props. Use React Router to build out separate 'views' for creating,
editing, updating and deleting instances of your model.

Stick to just 1 model and keep it simple. The purpose of this lab is to practice
working with Express and React. Your goal should be to have full CRUD on one
model with a React front-end and Express back-end.

## Bonus

Add another model as a sub-document. Finish full CRUD on your first model before
adding a subdocument. Make it so users can perform full CRUD on the
sub-document.

## Double Bonus

Deploy your app. Use heroku for the backend and surge for the frontend.
